# Compiling BioKG from source
BioKG requires python3.7 or greater to run

## Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/dsi-bdi/biokg.git
cd biokg
```

## Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Compile the BioKG
```bash
python run_all.py '<drugbank_username>' '<drugbank_password>'
```

After the script completes there should be a data folder in the biokg folder
This data folder will have 4 folders
- sources which contains the sources used to compile BioKG
- preprocessed which contains the extracted data in preprocessed form
- output which contains the process data and benchmarks
- biokg which contains the final biokg data

There will also be 2 zip files similar to the files contained in the release
- biokg.zip which contains the compressed contents of the biokg folder
- benchmarks.zip which contains the compressed contents of the output/benchmarks folder

# Compiling BioKG with docker

## Building docker image
```bash
sudo docker build . -t dsi-bdi/biokg
```
## Running the image
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -v <data_path>:/biokg/data -e DB_USER='<drugbank_username>' -e DB_PASS='<drugbank_password>' dsi-bdi/biokg:latest
```
- where <data_path> is the fully qualified path to your data folder

## Data Sources
The biokg is built using the following data sources.
